# Tennessee FGC Website

The Tennessee Fighting Game Community is pretty large and separated.  The amount of times I run into new players and they say they couldn't find any information about the scene is way more than it should be.  So this website is an attempt to help consolidate information to make it easier for people to find the events and players near them.
